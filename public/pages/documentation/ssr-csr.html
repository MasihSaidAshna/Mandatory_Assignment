                When rendering a page in an application it is either done from a server-side (SSR) or the client's side (CSR). 
                Each approach to this rendering process has its advantages and disadvantages and the factors that come to play are usually performance,  application complexity and maintenance.

            <h3>Server-Side Rendering</h3>
            <p>
                Like the name suggests, this rendering process is handled on the server's side. 
                On an HTML page  the content is generated in response to the client's request; the server processes said request, executes server-side code and dynamically generates the HTML.
                One trade-off you take when choosing to implement SSR over CSR is  that the performance suffers from high complexity applications with a lot of dynamic content.
                An example of an SSR implementation can be found in the code of this very project; there lies a templating engine JavaScript file which is responsible for rendering the pages.
            </p>
            <h3>Client-Side Rendering</h3>
            <p>
                Like the name suggests, CSR is about rendering HTML content on the client's side. There are several front-end JavaScript frameworks that use this method, such as React.js, Angular.js and Vue.js.
