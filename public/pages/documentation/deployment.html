            <h2>What is deployment?</h2>
            <p>
                Deployment refers to the process of making a software application available for use by its inteded users/customers. 
                The software that is deployed is a product that has been tested and developed thoroughly. 
                When deployment is discussed amongst programming groups it is often in conjunction with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), which means that code changes are merged into one repository and is then deployed.
                When the software is deployed it is often done so by making it accessible on the cloud.

                Vercel is a cloud platform used for deploying web applications. It focuses on being user-friendly for deploying and hosting frontend and backend applications.
                Vercel works well with Node.js and Express; it handles dependencies for you and there's likely to be no code changes.
