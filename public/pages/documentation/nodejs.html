                Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment. A key feature behind Node.js is its package system, npm, which is used to access innumerous libaries and modules.
                Node.js has the benefit of server-side rendering, which means the server is often used to generate dynamic HTML content before the page is sent to the client. 
                THanks to its event-driven architecture, Node.js is capable of asynchronous I/O. This means appliations can handle many connections at the same time and respond quickly.
                It is ideally suited for building REST APIs.

            <h2>Using Node.js in the terminal</h2>
            <p>
                Usage Node.js comes with using your terminal a lot of the time. The table below shows some examples of common commands one would type in the terminal when using Node.js.
            </p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>

            <h2>REST API conventions</h2>
            <span>
                There are 3 conventions when it comes to REST:
            </span>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    HTTP methods (verbs)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ordering
                </li>
                <li>
                    Naming nouns in plural or singular 
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>HTTP methods</h3>
            <p>REST APIs use HTTP methods to perform different actions. The most commonly used are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. 
                GET is used to retrieve data from a resource, POST creates a new resource, PUT updates an existing resource and DELETE deletes a resource.</p>
            <h3>Ordering</h3>
            <p>Ordering in API responses. This convention is about maintaining consistent ordering of resources which in turn increases usability and maintainability of te API.</p>
            <h3>Naming</h3>
            <p>The naming conventions for resources in REST API follow a pattern of nouns for resources and plural nouns for collections of resources. 
                An example of this could be retrieving a user, where the endpoint would be "/user". When retrieving a collection of users, this endpoint would then be "/users".</p>
