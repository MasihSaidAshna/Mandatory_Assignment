            <p>
                Express is an application framework used in Node.js for building web applications. The framework provides a wide range of utilities which makes the building process simpler and more manageable. 
                Express is often used together with a template engine. There are popular ones like EJS, Pug and Handlebars. 
                In this project I've made a file "templatingEngine.js" which handles reading and rendering pages in the application. It also attaches header, footer and side-menu to the page.

            <h2>Routing</h2>
            <p>
                Express has a simple yet intuitive way of defining routes to HTTP requests. These routes are defined with HTTP methods (verbs) such as 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT' and 'DELETE'. 
                The way to define a basic route in Express is done this way:
                <pre>
                    const express = require('express');
                    const app = express();

                    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
                        res.send('');
                    });
                </pre>
                In this example, the route for the homepage marked by the endpoint <code>'/'</code> simply responds to the request by sending an empty string back. 
            </p>
            <h2>Clean code conventions</h2>
            <p>
                Clean code conventions refer to a set of guidelines regarding writing code that is easy to understand, maintain and modify. 
                When the code is clean it helps improving readability of the program and reducing complexity. 
                This is why these conventions are taken very seriously when you have to work in a group of developers who all have to put their hands on the code. &#10;&#13;
                Some examples of said conventions are: Good naming, consistent styling, single responsibility, don't repeat yourself and documentation.
