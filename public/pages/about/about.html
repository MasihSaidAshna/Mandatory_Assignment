            <p>
                Welcome to the project. My name is Said Masih Ashna. &#10;&#13;
                I'm a programmer from Roskilde, Denmark who's relatively new to the computer science world. I aim to explore many different areas of the programming world, hence why I'm currently studying Node.js. &#10;&#13;
                In my experience with programming I've mostly worked with backend work, so node.js and Javascript are quite new to me as a whole. 
                In this project I have designed many different pages to show and tell you what topics we've been through in this course.
